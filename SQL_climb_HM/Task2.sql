---Conclusion: 

-- After creating the table and deleting 1/3 of the rows, the storage size didnâ€™t change until we ran vacuum, what clean unused space.
-- Finally, using truncate emptied the table completely and reduced its size to almost zero.

-- My note that after deleting rows, it's important to run the `VACUUM` function to clean unused space and optimize database performance.
